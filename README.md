Welcome!
This program when ran in two seperate terminals emulates communication between client & server. 

The final result is similar to a Pokedex in Pokemon where the user can search up a Pokemon type and it will go through Pokemon.csv file containing hundreds on Pokemon and will create a seperate .csv file with all the Pokemon with the matching type. 

This is done using concurrent programming - which makes use of threads and sockets so that multple processes can occur at the sametime resulting in a fast program. 

If there are any questions please email me at christopher.gawdzik@gmail.com
